            <div class="entry-content"><p>Google AdSense is an ad serving application run by Google Inc. Website owners can enroll in this program to enable text, image, and videoadvertisements on their websites. These advertisements are administered, sorted, and maintained by Google, and they can generate revenue on either a per-click or per-impression basis. Google beta tested a cost-per-action service, but discontinued it in October 2008 in favor of aDoubleClick offering (also owned by Google). In Q1 2011, Google earned US$2.34 billion ($9.36 billion annualized), or 28% of total revenue, through AdSense. </p>
            <p>But despite of Google there are other publisher networks who can pay you if you register and perform good. </p>
            <p align="left">who are the publishers who pay?<br>
                Some of the publisher networks are <br>

                Tyroo<br>
